* Ethernet frame Structure
For what Ethernet is , I would like you to visit http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/Ethernet.
What more important is to understand what are the fields/sections of Ethernet frame. \\
See the image given below -

First and foremost, the most important thing is that an Ethernet Frame comes into action at Data Link Layer of OSI model. 
Everything which will be carried away in the network, weather it is a video, audio, text message, anything, will be carried in the Ethernet frame. \\

From fields/sections given above, we will only care about the following -
** Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)
   This is the MAC address of the destination machine where the frame is to be sent.
** Source MAC Address (6 bytes)
   This is the MAC address of the machine which is sending the frane.
** Type (2 bytes)
   Type field is used to carry the information about what type of Data packet is geeting carried in Ethernet Frame.
   For every frame, it will have a specific value in hexadecimal format. Two most important packets carried by Ethernet Frame are - \\
   1. ARP Packet - When an ARP (Request/Respone) packet is carried in data section of Ethernet frame, Ethernet type has value 0x0806. \\
   2. IP Packet - When an IP packet is carried in data section of Ethernet frame, Ethernet type has value 0x0800. 

** Data/Payload (variable from 46 bytes to 1500 bytes)
   This section carries the data in the Ethernet frame. This data can be any packet from layer above the Data Link Layer of the frame. 
   When an Ethernet frame is carrying nothing, then the size of the Data section is 46 bytes. The maximum data it can carry is of size 1500 bytes.
  
Lets us consider a simple connectivity between two computers (See image below ) -
#+CAPTION: Sample topology
#+NAME: fig:eth2

If PC1 wants to communicate with PC2, then Pc1 will form an Ethernet frame and will send it on to the wire. \\
PC1 will then fill values in the frame which will look like the one given below.
#+CAPTION: Custom frame
#+NAME: fig:eth3

- Ethernet frame formed by PC1 to send it to PC2
- First block is the MAC address of Destination machine, i.e. PC2. 
- Second block is the MAC address of Source machine, i.e. PC1. 
- Third block is the DATA or payload section.

Note: There are some other fields, but for the sake of understanding, we can ignore them. \\

A check sum will be calculated at both sender’s and receiver’s side, so as to confirm the integrity of data sent by sender.

Now you can go ahead with my blog article on Address Resolution Protocol.
